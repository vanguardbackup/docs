Vanguard currently supports four types of Notification Streams:

1. Discord Webhooks
2. Email Notifications
3. Slack Webhooks
4. Microsoft Teams Webhooks

## Setting Up Notification Streams

1. Navigate to the Notification Streams section in your Vanguard dashboard.
2. Choose your preferred notification channel.
3. Configure the necessary details (e.g., webhook URL for Discord, Slack or Teams, email addresses for email notifications).
4. Save your configuration.

## Applying Notifications

When creating or updating a Backup Task, you can select which Notification Streams to use.

::: info Note
Regardless of your chosen Notification Streams, you will always receive backup failure notifications to your account's registered email address. This ensures you never miss critical alerts about your backups.

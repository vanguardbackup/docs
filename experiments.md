- A description of the new feature being tested
- The area of the project it affects (e.g., UI/UX, performance)
- Options to enable or disable the feature

## User Control

Unlike traditional A/B testing, Vanguard gives you full control over your participation:

- You can enable or disable any available experiment at any time.
- All experiments are opt-in, allowing you to try new features at your own pace.

## Feedback

Your feedback on experiments is invaluable:

- While using experimental features, pay attention to your experience.
- Use the provided feedback channels to share your thoughts, suggestions, or report any issues.

By participating in experiments, you play a crucial role in Vanguard's development, helping to refine and improve features before their official release.
